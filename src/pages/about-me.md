Hi, 👋.  
I’m an **Information Technology** major at **Florida International University** 🏫 and an aspiring **Solutions Architect** .  

My journey has been shaped by **resilience**, **setbacks**, and the determination to keep moving forward.  

> This blog is where I share my story the wins, the struggles, and the lessons learned along the way.

## My Journey 🌱⚽🏑

I was born and raised in **Trelawny, Jamaica**, in the rural parts beside sugar cane plantations.

Growing up in a *single-parent household*, life was not easy. I often woke up at *five in the morning* to travel into the city for school, a place very different from what I was used to.  

---

Sports became my outlet. I ran track in the *100m* and *200m*, played ⚽ **soccer** and 🏑 **field hockey**, which taught me discipline, competitiveness, and resilience.  


Later, I attended a **Catholic prep school** and then **boarding school**. Those years were difficult, marked by strict discipline and experiences of abuse, but they also shaped my determination to rise above hardship and become stronger.  

---

Eventually, I became an **international student in the United States** 🇺🇸. That transition brought new challenges, including the high cost of out-of-state tuition and the difficulty of being away from home.  


Soccer had been my dream, and I hoped to earn a scholarship, but a series of injuries during the *COVID years* ,  from **hamstring tears** to an **ACL setback** ,  ended my competitive career.  


I transferred schools, searching for opportunities, but coming from a country with limited infrastructure, I did not know the pipelines necessary to make it. Injured and unable to return to my previous level of skill and fitness, my scholarship hopes faded.  

---

Despite these setbacks, I kept moving forward. I worked **two jobs** while juggling *full-time studies*, determined to pay for school and build a future. I faced failed interviews and disappointments, but I never gave up.  

> "My childhood hardships gave me a deep motivation to become the person my younger self needed."  

Those experiences shaped my **resilience** and drive to keep striving for the best version of myself.

## Passion, Values, and Motivation 🏆🔥🤝

My passion is **to win ,  always, in everything I do**.  
Winning means proving to myself that I can rise above setbacks, dominate challenges, and keep pushing forward.  

But winning isn’t just about me ,  it’s also about creating opportunities for others.  
Helping people succeed fuels my own drive, because every victory I inspire is part of my legacy.  

---

For me, *winning* is both personal and shared:
- 🏃 I push my body and mind to their limits  
- ⚡ I thrive on competition and the drive to be first  
- 🚀 I set goals that others think are impossible ,  then I crush them  
- 🌟 I refuse to settle for “good enough”  
- 🤝 I win again when I help others rise with me  

> "I win by becoming better, and I win again by helping others do the same."

## Beyond Tech ⚽🏑💪🎮🤝🌍

Outside of engineering, I’m passionate about **soccer**, **field hockey**, **fitness**, and **running** ,  even if my competitive career ended earlier than planned. Sports remain a core part of my identity, teaching me discipline and resilience.

I study **businesses and entrepreneurship** 📈 because I want to build my own one day.  
I also dive into **machine learning research** 🤖 and enjoy **gaming** 🎮 as a way to recharge and explore new worlds.  

---

Beyond personal passions, I care deeply about **giving back**:  
- 🤝 Volunteering for charity  
- 🏠 Helping the homeless  
- 🌍 Supporting relief efforts in my country after it was devastated by a hurricane
